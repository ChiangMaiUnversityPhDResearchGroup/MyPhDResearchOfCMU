## ● What is research?What is Doctoral study?
It is a hard question for what is research.
I think if human kind would be keeping evolution, someone must devote into research to know why and how.

So, research is a exploring for unknown answers in the universe,in our life, world, try to explain something. 
It is Philosophy for human kind.

We must have some correct ways to explore and find the answer to verify for the world,to get a repeatable and verifiable result.
So, it is a scientific methodological process.


For me, I would choose reading and researching for my left life, it is calm, it is full of energy when I try to find some solutions or answers in the knowledge ocean. It my life, my choice, it is fun for me.
The happiness in researching is much better and more sustainable than entertainments or drinking, eating and something else, for me.

So, research is a life style for us.
