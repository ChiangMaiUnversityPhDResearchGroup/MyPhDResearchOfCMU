## ● What is research?What is Doctoral study?
It is a hard question for what is research.
I think if human kind would be keeping evolution, someone must devote into research to know why and how.

So, research is a exploring for unknown answers in the universe,in our life, world, try to explain something. 
It is Philosophy for human kind.

We must have some correct ways to explore and find the answer to verify for the world,to get a repeatable and verifiable result with method.
So, it is a scientific methodological process.
And for me, I want find some TRUE questions for human, like the advertisement, I think it is unfair for normals, so I don't set my focus on improve the advertisement technology, but try to find something to replace the advertisement. Sometimes I call this Innovation or Destructive Innovation.


For my doctoral study, I will try to explore in some narrow areas like Improve the private key keeping method to protect the normals digital asset

In a long time, I would choose reading and researching for my left life, it is calm, it is full of energy when I try to find some solutions or answers in the knowledge ocean. It my life, my choice, it is fun for me.
The happiness in researching is much better and more sustainable than entertainments or drinking, eating and something else, for me.

So, research is a life style for me.
