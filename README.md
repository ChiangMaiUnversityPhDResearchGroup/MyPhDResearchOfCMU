# MyPhDResearchOfCMU
A Ph.D. research journey in Chiang Mai University, Digital Innovation and Financial Technology.

## Start
On 25th, June 2023, I arrived at Chiang Mai University.

## Gap
I find individuals may get a better life with their decentralized reputation network and more social capital.
I will focus on these topics in my PhD research:
Decentralized Attestation (with ZKP, Blockchain, and community network)
Decentralized Verification and Reputation
Reputation Network and Computing

## More
I will launch a small experiment to get more data for this research, including the Reputation circling model
